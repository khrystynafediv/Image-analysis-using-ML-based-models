This project was carried out during my participation in UBDS (Ukrainian biological data science summer school)
This code allows you analyse 3D microscopy images using a model from [Bioimage.io](https://bioimage.io/#/models).

Miniconda/Anaconda manager installation is highly recommended before the course. 
Please, download an installation file (environment.yml) from this repo.
